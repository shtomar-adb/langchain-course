A few years back, i loved to read. I’d open the newspaper in the morning, fall asleep with a book, keep it under my pillow which made the pillow bulky, but at least it wasn’t emitting radiation. First thing in the morning, I’d read again. I’d compare cars in magazines, binge kids’ mags & everything.

Now, times have changed. I don’t read newspapers anymore although sometimes I do, and I always feel better (and informed) when I do but mostly, I don’t. In 2024, I set a goal to read 12 books (one a month). I started and failed miserably: finished just 6. This year, 2025, I tried the same goal. It’s november, and I’ve read 2. I want to read; I procrastinate.
Things have changed. The pillow isn’t bulky anymore, but it has radiation. I don’t even know if car magazines still exist. Back then, I used to compare torque and horsepower. Now I just feel motivated about cars after watching some 15-second edit from a motivational channel. But half the time, I’m not even sure if the car’s got power under the hood or if I’m just reacting to the music and lighting. We used to care about what was inside, now we just stare at the shine outside (in case of books as well).

Even more sobering, the little neighborhood bookstore that’s been here for 50 years just closed, replaced by a new phone accessories shop. If that isn’t a sign of the times, I don’t know what is. And honestly, maybe it’s partly my fault too. The last time I bought something from that store was years ago. These days, I hear about a book from a random tweet or a podcast guest talking about their “big fascination,” and I just order it on Amazon; where it then sits untouched on my shelf, still waiting to be read. Reading which was once a default pastime, now seems to be dying a slow death in our always-connected, TikTok-addled era. What the hell happened to our ability to sit down with a book? Why do we want to read more, yet find ourselves doom-scrolling or watching 15-second motivational clips instead?

I’m not alone in this struggle. Statistics show a stark decline in reading habits across the board. In 2000, the average American read about 18 books a year by 2021 that was down to roughly 12. And nearly half of U.S. adults did not read a single book in 2023. Let that sink in: if you managed to read even two books this year, you’re ahead of about 50% of people.

Meanwhile, the median Medium article (like this one) can barely hold attention; even before you started reading this, you might have noticed the little indicator beside my name of “16 min read” and felt an instinctive ugh, that’s too long and if you did not, you’re a legend for me! I can confirm this from my own blog stats: one of my longest articles (~27 minute read) only kept ~41% of readers for at least 30 seconds, whereas shorter pieces (~10–15 minutes) have around a 50% 30-second read rate. In other words, over half of readers don’t even give a story 30 seconds before clicking away. Ouch. Maybe people just didn’t like my story or my writing style; that’s very possible. But whatever the reason, a 40–50% read ratio is low. And this isn’t some global data point; it’s my own stats. I don’t even know what the average read ratio on Medium is, maybe mine genuinely is’nt good enough, who knows. But even then, it still tells that people bounce fast. Our attention span is genuinely fruked.

But how did we get here? From what I understand, there are several intertwining reasons may that be technological, psychological, or educational; all converging to sabotage our attention span and our reading habits.

The digital attention crisis and why reading feels so hard

We live in a world of infinite distractions. Our smartphones buzz and beckon constantly; in fact, the average smartphone user checks their phone a whooping 58 times a day! (about once every 15 waking minutes!). Each check brings a flood of new notifications, feeds, and content competing for a slice of our mind. There’s a war for attention going on, and our poor brains are the battlefield. Guess what ends up on the losing side of that war? Long, quiet, linear activities like reading a book.

The Attention Crisis Is Just a Distraction | The New Yorker.

Modern media is ruthlessly optimized to grab and hold our focus (at least for a few seconds). Take Netflix’s findings: according to former Netflix VP of Product Todd Yellin, viewers in 2023 would decide whether to keep watching a show within the first 7 seconds of the episode. Seven seconds! As a result, Netflix now often starts shows in mid-action (think explosions, screams, a dead body on the floor) to hook you instantly. If even big-budget TV shows must deliver a dopamine jolt within seconds, how can a slow-burn novel compete?

It’s not just TV. News media has also bowed to shrinking attention spans. The Associated Press which once ran 800-word articles as standard; began dramatically shortening its stories over the past two decades. By 2014, AP’s editors were instructing journalists that most stories should stay between 300–500 words (only major ones up to 700) because “readers lack the attention span for long stories”. In the AP editor’s own blunt words, if an article was too long, today’s reader simply wouldn’t finish it. (And indeed, you might be skimming this article right now, thinking “get to the point!”)

And look at the news platforms that are exploding these days; platforms like Inshorts. We don’t even want 300 words anymore; we want the whole world compressed into a 12-word notification. Headlines have become the entire story, summaries have replaced reading, and somehow we feel “caught up”.

    Also, if you’re still here reading this… respect. You’re clearly not in that group, because wow you’ve already crossed like 1,200 words.

This deluge of bite-sized content has fundamentally changed our brains (or at least our habits). We’ve grown accustomed to constant stimulation. Social media feeds, short videos, clickbait headlines; they flood our senses with quick rewards. Psychologists have said that we now live in a state of continuous partial attention, our focus split among many inputs. If there’s a brief lull (a quiet moment with “nothing” happening) we reach for our phones to fill it. Sitting alone in silence feels… wrong. Author David Foster Wallace observed this trend even back in 2003, noting that many intelligent people he knew had developed an almost dread of quiet solitude; they’d rather be anywhere than “alone in a room” with just a book and their thoughts. As Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at UVA put it,

    “Being bored has become unnatural.”

Reading, unfortunately, requires exactly what we’re losing: solitude, quiet, and sustained focus. A novel doesn’t bombard you with pop-ups and push alerts. A history book unfolds its argument slowly, requiring patience and attention to detail. That feels increasingly torturous to a brain hooked on the high-frequency hits of digital media. We’re like hummingbirds trying to dive into a deep, calm lake; our wings are flapping too fast to let us sink in.

Here’s an important nuance: it’s not that our brains literally can’t focus for long anymore. We can still binge-watch eight hours of a gripping Netflix series in one sitting, or play a video game all afternoon. The human attention span isn’t dead but it’s just been retrained. We’ve gotten used to what author Mark Manson calls “multi-tracking” i.e. constantly switching between threads, apps, and stimuli for quick bursts of engagement. Deep reading, by contrast, asks us to single-task on one thing for an extended period. At first, that single task (even if it’s an enjoyable book) feels slow and boring compared to the rapid-fire feedback of our devices. Our threshold for “I wonder what else is happening” is now so low that even on page 5 of a book, we feel the itch to check messages or scroll a feed.

It doesn’t help that we are perpetually information-overloaded. We have millions of books, articles, and posts at our fingertips. When information was scarce, our attention could afford to dwell on one thing at length. Now, information is effectively infinite and our attention is spread thin across countless tiny fragments. As Manson explains: when you have thousands of bits of stimulation coming at you, your mind constantly has to decide what to focus on next, making your default state one of fragmentation. In such an environment, anything that doesn’t deliver instant gratification is at a serious disadvantage. Sadly, books often fall into that category.
Why Nobody Can Read Anymore | Mark Manson.
The paradox of choice (Too many books, Too little focus)

Ironically, one reason we read less now is because we have more reading material available than ever before. How is that possible? It comes down to the paradox of choice: having too many options can actually paralyze us or leave us dissatisfied. Psychologists demonstrated this in the famous “jam study”; shoppers offered 24 flavors of jam were 1/10th as likely to buy any as shoppers offered only 6 flavors. With so many choices, many people froze up and bought nothing at all.

Now apply that to books. You have literally millions of books (classics, new releases, e-books, audiobooks, fanfiction, etc.) a click away. If a novel doesn’t totally grab you by Chapter 2, it’s all too easy to think, “Meh, there must be something better out there. Maybe the next book will be the magical one that rekindles my love of reading.” So you skim a chapter or two, lose interest, and abandon it for another title which you might also abandon. We graze from an infinite buffet of books but rarely stay long enough to enjoy a full meal. The abundance of options means we’re forever chasing the ideal book that will perfectly hold our attention, and feeling FOMO about the books we haven’t gotten to. In the end, we often end up reading nothing at all start-to-finish.

I’ve caught myself in this trap. I’ll start a book that’s objectively great, but the moment it gets a bit slow or challenging, part of my brain says, “You know, that new bestseller on Kindle sounds more fun than this. Why not switch?” In the old days, when you had a few books on your shelf, you’d push through a slow chapter. Today, with endless alternatives on demand, our patience is paper-thin.

    More choice has made us less content with any choice we make.

This paradox of choice doesn’t just hinder starting books but it also affects finishing them too. We carry an implicit expectation now that every moment of content consumption should be entertaining. If a book has lulls or requires effort, we wonder if we’d be happier consuming something else. But every book, even great ones, have slower parts or require some build-up. The result: we have a harder time persevering through those necessary slow bits. We drop the book and look for a new dopamine hit elsewhere. Indeed, we’ve become “goldfish” with our literature; always distracted by the next shiny thing.
Burnout and mental exhaustion

Even if you manage to resist digital temptations, you might simply be too tired to read. Modern life (especially work and school) is mentally draining in new ways. We’re juggling dozens of micro-tasks all day: emails, Slack chats, Zoom calls, project updates, never-ending notification pings. Cognitive scientist Cal Newport calls this the hyperactive hive mind of modern knowledge work, and it taxes our brains heavily. By evening, your mind might feel like mush. In that state, curling up with a book (which actually requires brainpower) may sound as appealing as doing math homework or chugging dish soap.

Burnout is extremely common now. In a 2022 Gallup report, 76% of people admitted to experiencing burnout at least sometimes, and about 28% said they feel burned out “all the time.” High stress and mental fatigue directly impair our ability to concentrate or remember details. The American Psychological Association warned in 2021 that over half of U.S. adults (around 53%) were struggling to focus for extended periods due to stress, burnout, or constant digital distractions. When your mind is frazzled, trying to read a dense novel or a long nonfiction book becomes frustrating and you find yourself rereading the same paragraph three times because nothing sticks. Before long, you give up, fire up Netflix or YouTube, and give your brain the equivalent of junk food because it’s too exhausted to chew real food.

I feel this deeply. After a hectic workday of switching between 20 browser tabs and 10 chat threads, I often want to read as a way to wind down. I’ll pick up a book at 9pm, hoping for a peaceful escape. But my brain, still buzzing from the day’s overload, rebels. I notice I’ve read 4 pages without absorbing any of it. I flick open my phone “just for a second” to check something and suddenly an hour is gone. The book lies abandoned on my nightstand while I numb out with easy digital fodder. This, I suspect, is a nightly routine for millions.

There’s also another psychological barrier: after a day of hustling and information overload, reading can weirdly feel like more work. Especially if the book is intellectually demanding or teaching you something, your wbrain might register it as an extension of the day’s efforts rather than relaxation. Many people now categorize reading as a productive, virtuous activity (the sort of thing you think you should do, like exercise), as opposed to a fun leisure activity. So when we’re drained, we avoid it, opting for passive consumption instead.

Modern work culture and hustle culture contribute here too. We’re always “on,” always optimizing our time. Taking a slow hour to read a novel can almost induce guilt; shouldn’t I be answering emails or working on a side project or learning a new skill instead? This mindset that every minute must be monetized or maximized poisons the simple pleasure of reading for reading’s sake. (Some even try to turn reading itself into a productivity hack by speed-reading or only consuming book summaries which, while sometimes useful, kind of misses the point if your goal is to enjoy a good book and decompress.)

All of this means by the time we do have a free hour to read, we’re either too mentally spent to focus, or we subconsciously resist because we’ve trained ourselves to equate “sit down and read” with “more work/effort.” The path of least resistance is to scroll Instagram or watch TV, which asks nothing of us. And so the books gather dust.
The lost art of deep reading

A lot of us never actually learned how to sit with long text or we lost the habit somewhere along the way. Schools stopped making us read whole books; instead we got excerpts, worksheets, and “find the main idea in this one-page passage” drills. That builds test-takers, not readers.

So we grew up without reading stamina (a child’s ability to focus and read independently for long-ish periods of time without being distracted or without distracting others). And when you don’t build that muscle young, finishing a book later feels like running a marathon without training. Even college kids today tell professors they “can’t read a whole book in a week.” That used to be normal.

It’s not that we can’t read; we can still decode words. We just can’t stay with them.

And honestly, look at what we trade reading for: endless scrolling, flickering feeds, notifications, “bite-sized knowledge.” Six minutes of reading can drop stress by 68%, yet most of us never give our brains those six minutes. We go for the quick hit instead.

    Books build imagination, patience, empathy, and actual independent thinking. But when we stop reading deeply, we lose depth. We skim life the same way we skim content.

Aimlessness is the enemy of learning

Now, let’s talk about one more internal factor: motivation. Half the time, we don’t even know why we’re reading. I’ll be honest here; part of the reason I haven’t hit my reading goal this year is that I often lacked a strong purpose or curiosity driving me. I’d tell myself “I should read more,” but why? Just because it’s a virtuous thing to do? That kind of vague aimlessness is kryptonite for sustaining any habit, reading included. The moments in my life when I tore through books were times when I was deeply interested in something. For example, when I was obsessed with a particular historical period, I devoured novels and histories about it. When I wanted to improve a skill or understand a topic (say, programming or philosophy), I plowed through relevant books with zeal. My focus had an anchor: a genuine desire to know.

We say “I should read more” like it’s a diet plan and that never lasts. And now we also have shortcuts. Ask a question? Google. Need context? A 5-minute YouTube explainer. Want the key takeaways from a 300-page book? ChatGPT hands it to you in 30 seconds. Useful? Sure. But it kills patience.

    AI didn’t make me stupid; it made me impatient.

And then suddenly a book feels too slow. Why read 300 pages when 50 pages actually matter, and AI can give you those 50 pages in one prompt? That voice in the head gets louder:
“Why am I slogging? I could get the answer faster.”

So we scroll. We skim. We “consume.” And we lose the joy of getting lost in a book.

The fix is simple but not easy: read what genuinely fascinates you. Not what you should read. Curiosity beats discipline every single time.
Why successful people read

There’s an interesting contrast to note: even as the average person reads less, many of the world’s most successful and busy people are voracious readers. It’s almost a cliché ; billionaire investor Warren Buffett spending 5+ hours a day reading, or Bill Gates reading ~50 books a year and famously taking week-long “reading vacations.” In fact, in one study of self-made millionaires, 85% reported reading two or more books per month (mostly self-education, biography, and self-improvement titles). These are folks with packed schedules, yet they prioritize reading consistently. Bill Gates has said that reading is “essential to his success,” a habit as fundamental as breathing for him. Why? What do they see in reading that perhaps the rest of us are missing?

One answer is that reading offers a tremendous ROI (return on investment) on your time (if you choose the right material). Think about it: an author might spend 5 years researching and writing a book, distilling a decade of expertise or experience into those pages. You can absorb the fruit of those 5 years in maybe 5 hours of reading. That’s an insanely good deal!

    Reading a book is like compressing years of someone’s wisdom into a few evenings on your couch — Steven Kotler.

Even reading one solid 15-minute article can transmit knowledge that took the writer days or months to gather. High achievers are keenly aware of this leverage. Every book is a potential mentor, a “life experience hack” that can give you lessons it took someone else decades to learn; all without you having to live those decades yourself. (In fact, in that millionaire study, 93% credited mentors for their success and noted that books can serve as surrogate mentors when real-life ones aren’t available.)

Another reason successful people read: it’s a way to stay innovative and informed. The world changes fast, and reading widely (not just tweets and headlines, but deep dives) exposes you to diverse ideas and knowledge. It’s notable that reading correlates with education level and income. And as one moves up in levels of success, the reading often increases; CEOs and leaders commonly report reading dozens of books a year on business, leadership, history, etc. It’s both a cause and effect: reading makes you more knowledgeable (and potentially more successful), and the most successful then double down on reading to maintain their edge.

When I consider that by reading a great book I might gain years’ worth of insight, or spark a creative idea that could change my life or career, it suddenly feels more urgent to put down the phone and pick up the book. Reading isn’t just a leisure activity; it’s a form of self-development and even competitive advantage.

    Not to mention, it can make you a more interesting person to talk to at parties; readers have the best stories and facts up their sleeve!

That said, you shouldn’t approach reading only as a utilitarian means to an end. The joy of it is important too; it’s why those successful folks often read outside their direct field (Gates reads about everything from climate science to WWII to Buddhism). They maintain a childlike curiosity about the world. I suspect that’s a big factor: treat reading not as a chore or checkbox, but as an exploratory adventure. Remember when you were a kid and loved dinosaurs so much you read a bunch of dinosaur books? Or you got into a fantasy series and read all night under the covers? Recapturing that spirit doing it for fun, for the wonder of learning or getting lost in a story is key. If reading is always framed as a serious self-improvement duty, it will feel heavy. The most dedicated readers often are the ones who genuinely find it enjoyable.
